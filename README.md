# memdir
An alloc that gives you space in an auto-expanding mmap'd file and a way to reload pointers.

## Dependencies
glib2 and cmake.

## Caveats
Has not been touched since 2006, but the tests still pass (on Linux).

Extracted from another project, may contain unused code.

Originally written to compile with -std=c89, but gcc complains about glib using `__FUNCTION__` in a macro, so I had to use -std=c99 to get it to build.

Designed to be compatible with Linux, Windows, and BSD, but I have only recently tested it on Linux.

## Compiling
Build test with ex:

```
mkdir -p target/debug
cd target/debug
cmake ../..
make
./test2
```
